+++ Instructions for running Flask and this application +++

In your shell/command-line/terminal


+++ [1] Install Flask using your preferred Python's pip or pip3 installer.
    You may need to include a path to pip, e.g., /path-to-pip/pip install flask :

    /path-to-pip/pip install flask


+++ [2] Be sure you know where the files are for this project...

Still at your shell/command-line/terminal:

    cd to FinalApp


+++ [3] Set environment variables, different for Mac vs Windows:

[Mac] If you're on a MAC/Linux, run these two commands at the terminal:
    export FLASK_APP=yelp-app.py   
    export FLASK_ENV=development   
    
[Win] If you're on a Windows machine, run these two commands at the command-line:    
    set FLASK_APP=yelp-app.py   
    set FLASK_ENV=development    

If the above commands work, you won't see any response.


+++ [4] Run Flask:

Still at the command-line, run

    python -m flask run

(be sure you're in the FinalApp folder)
If it works, you should see a number of messages, and then
